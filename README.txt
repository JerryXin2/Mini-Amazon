Link to access github Repository, with all code: https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/mx47/mini-amazon-skeleton
The code to populate the sample database is found under mx47/mini-amazon-skeleton/db/data.

The three files used to generate the sample data are:
mx47/mini-amazon-skeleton/db/data/Products.csv
mx47/mini-amazon-skeleton/db/data/Purchases.csv
mx47/mini-amazon-skeleton/db/data/Users.csv

These have been all edited to create a more comprehensive database that can catch more edge cases and provide an
overall more reliable set of test cases.
